                            <p>By 2030, we will have substantial numbers of self-driving pods, most will have light rail too and a few cities might have Hyperloop-style rail. There will still be many conventional vehicles so it will be a diverse mixture. The skies won’t have flying cars but will have drones varying in size from small insects through to metres across, doing jobs like surveillance, security, delivery, building, decorating and maintenance.</p>
                            <p>
                                The concept of privacy in a public place will vanish: if now people in the subway - it's just some people in the subway, in the nearest future, everyone will be able to see your name, place of work, age, orientation and your marital status with the help of augmented reality glasses.

                                You may ask, "How come, I didn’t leave anything of this on social networks?" Consider such a situation. Suppose a member of a group of enthusiasts from the community "Deanonymizers" automatically reports to an open online database: "I'm in this subway car, see 20 people at this station." Another enthusiast in half an hour reports that the same person, that is you, was seen entering an apartment block, and so on.
                                
                                Thus, even if your photo cannot be found on the Internet next to your name, Deanonymizers will have the map of your movements and relocations, which sooner or later will acquire more and more details.</p>

                            <h5>Singapore 2030</h5>
                            <p>By 2030 the city has become interactive due to the ubiquitous introduction of smart surfaces. Any ordinary wall can now help a tourist find their way.

                                Ecology is a priority. Flying, swimming and crawling robots clean city streets and coastal waters. These eco-machines are charged by «green» energy sources: solar rays and the vertical temperature differences of sea water.</p>
                            <p>Plastic waste in the sea led to the formation of a massive garbage patch in the centre of the Pacific Ocean in late 20th century. Its area has continued to grow and exceed 1 million sq.km. by 2030. Plastic waste can be recycled and this has become the most popular way to fight pollution. To prevent waste getting into the sea, ecological drones with solar batteries have been deployed and now they are constantly working on cleaning coastal territories from plastic and delivering it to recycling plants.</p>
